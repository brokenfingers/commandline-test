    <h1>How to cook the perfect steak</h1>
    <section>
        <ul>
            <li>Let's start with the steak of course. I recommend a good quality thick (2-2.5cm cm thick) ribeye or sirloin steak with some fat running through it.</li>
            <li><b>Ribeye</b> tends to have a chunk of fat in the middle and some smaller veins of fat (see image above).</li>
            <li>Sirloin just tends to just have the smaller veins of fat.</li>
            <li>We're going to concentrate on those cuts, but I've also got a note on cooking fillet steak in the notes section of the recipe card.</li>
            <li>DON'T be scared of seeing fat on your steak - some of the fat renders down to help ensure a juicy steak. We also crisp up that fat when it's in the pan. Fat is GOOD!</li>
            <li>What you do need to look out for is gristle - these are streaks of chewy/rubbery cartillage, that aren't broken down during cooking. You sometimes find gristle as little wriggle lines of of-white in the steak. A little bit (that you can cut out when eating) is fine, but any more than that makes it a far less enjoyable steak.</li>
            <li><i>For cooking the steak,</i> we also need a high smoke point oil (such as sunflower oil), plenty of salt and freshly ground black pepper, a little butter, and if you want to to add some extra flavour, a few cloves of garlic and some fresh thyme or rosemary sprigs.</li>
        </ul>
